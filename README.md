# AceLocale3 Scraper #

A simple Ruby script that will scan an a World of Warcraft addon's source code looking for locale strings. These are collected and used to create the master locale file (e.g. the enUS base translations).
These translations can be uploaded to the WowAce localization app or distributed for translation by your user base.

### Notes ###

This script expects at least Ruby 1.9 for certain Regular Expression features.
